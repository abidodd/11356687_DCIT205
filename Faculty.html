    <h2> About the Faculty</h2>
    <p> 

        Currently, the Faculty runs a Bachelor of science in Computer Science, Bachelor of Science in Information Technology Management. It also runs Diploma programmes in Information Technology Management. The Faculty is headed by an academic Dean with a Faculty Officer who provides administrative support. The two departments are each headed by an academic Head of Department, each of whom is assisted by a Departmental Officer.
        
        The Faculty of Computer Science strives to provide students with a stimulating environment for learning and research. One way of achieving this is; student-lecturer ratio is always kept low. Lecturers and academic advisors are willing to provide relevant support to students when needed. Our collaboration with industry practitioners brings practicality to learning experiences in the lecture hall. Regularly, students pay industry visits and undertake internship programmes to acquire practical experience. The faculty’s participating in the university’s Annual Master Class Programme, also brings students into contact with industry giants in the fields of Computer Science and IT . This ensures that our students combine theory with practice and become relevant and competitive in the labour market.
        
        The Faculty also has a functional Language Centre that provides general linguistic teaching and learning as well as organizing short courses and proof-reading services to the general public.</p>
